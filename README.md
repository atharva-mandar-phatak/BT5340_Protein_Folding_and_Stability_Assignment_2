# Helix-Coil Model with Single Sequence Approximation

This repository contains an implementation of the **Helix-Coil Model** using the **Single Sequence Approximation (SSA)** for studying protein folding transitions. The model simulates helix-coil transitions in a polypeptide chain using dynamic programming, graph theory, and Monte Carlo simulations.
